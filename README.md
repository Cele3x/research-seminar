# Predicting Avatar Movement in Virtual Reality using Neural Networks
This repository was used for the project "Predicting Avatar Movement in Virtual Reality using Neural Networks" carried out as part of the course "Forschungsseminar" in the winter semester 2019/2020 at the University of Regensburg. 
Furthermore, this repository will be used to submit the final product. 

For the actual submission only the folder __submission__ , found in the root directory of this repository, is relevant. The folder contains several subfolders, sorted alphabetically: 
- [Folder#1](https://github.com/Cele3x/research-seminar/tree/master/submission/)
- [Folder#2](https://github.com/Cele3x/research-seminar/tree/master/submission/)

Each subfolder will be described in the following, starting with __Folder#1__: 

## Folder#1
Text

## Folder#2

## Docs 
This folder comprises two subfolder with the following containment:
- Paper: Final version of the scientific paper written during the project. 
- Projekt Handbuch: This is a document which elabroates how to use the developed movement prediciton system. It, as well, explaines a bit more technical back ground compared to the presented paper above. Additonally it grants deeper insight in the developed and presented Latency Test Framework.
