![Starting Scene](https://github.com/Cele3x/research-seminar/blob/master/submission/Images/teaser.png)
This repository was used for the project "Predicting Avatar Movement in Virtual Reality using Neural Networks" carried out as part of the course "Forschungsseminar" in the winter semester 2019/2020 at the University of Regensburg. 
Furthermore, this repository will be used to submit the final product. 

For the actual submission only the folder __submission__ , found in the root directory of this repository, is relevant. The folder contains several subfolders, sorted alphabetically: 
- [Folder#1](https://github.com/Cele3x/research-seminar/tree/master/submission/)
- [Folder#2](https://github.com/Cele3x/research-seminar/tree/master/submission/)

Each subfolder will be described in the following, starting with __Folder#1__: 

## Folder#1
Text

## Folder#2

## Docs 
This folder contains the final version of the scientific paper written during the project.
